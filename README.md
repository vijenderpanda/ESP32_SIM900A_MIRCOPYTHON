## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Developed and Tested by DevPanda

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Find Out the TX Pin And RX PIN on ESP32 where SIM Module is Connected. WORKS FOR SIM800 & SIM900A.
<!-- See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
No Package need to install Already there in the src 

Jus We need the Hardwares
1. ESP32
2. WIFI SSID AND PWD
3. SIM MODULE (SIM800/SIM900)
4. AZURE IOT HUB ACCOUNT 
5. OR ANY MQTT BROKER
```

<!-- ### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
